# Breadth First Search:
#   An algorithm designed for traversing a binary tree and/or data
# structure.  To begin, the algorithm starts at the tree root, or
# head, and steps down to the level below and checks each node on
# that particular level before moving down to the level below it.
# This process repeats until the target node is found.
